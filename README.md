## Play it again, Ferdynand!

`kiepscy-cli` is a small, terminal-based program written in Go, utilizing the [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) libraries. It was created as a fun and educational project (completed in just two evenings!) to grasp the basics of Go and build interactive terminal user interfaces.

So, what does it do? It allows you to play any episode of the iconic Polish TV series **"Świat według Kiepskich"** directly from your terminal!

## Features

* **Season Browse:** An intuitive list of all available seasons.
* **Episode Listing:** After selecting a season, you'll see a list of all episodes within that season.
* **Fuzzy Finding:** Quickly search for seasons and episodes by typing partial names.
* **Terminal Playback:** Select an episode, and it will be played using the external `mpv` media player.

## Dependencies

For the project to function correctly, you'll need the following dependencies:

### Go Modules:

* `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea`
* `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles`
* `github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss`

### External Video Player:

* `mpv` - A lightweight and versatile media player. It must be installed on your system and accessible within your `PATH` environment variable.

    **`mpv` Installation (examples):**
    * **macOS:** `brew install mpv`
    * **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt-get install mpv`
    * **Windows:** Download the installer from `mpv.io` or use a package manager (e.g., `scoop install mpv` / `choco install mpv`).

## Installation and Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kiki-Bouba-Game-Studio/kiepscy-cli.git # Change to your repository URL
    cd kiepscy-cli
    ```

2.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    go build
    ```
    This will compile the project and create an executable file named `kiepscy-cli` (or `kiepscy-cli.exe` on Windows) in the current directory.

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    ./kiepscy-cli # On Linux/macOS
    .\kiepscy-cli.exe # On Windows
    ```
    You can also run the application directly without prior compilation:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

## Controls

The program's interface is intuitive and keyboard-driven:

* **`↑` (Up Arrow) / `↓` (Down Arrow):** Navigate through the list (seasons or episodes).
* **`Enter` / `Space`:**
    * When on the season list: Selects a season and moves to its episode list.
    * When on the episode list: Plays the selected episode using `mpv`.
* **`Backspace` / `Esc`:**
    * When on the episode list: Go back to the season list.
    * When on the season list: Exit the application.
* **Any text input:** Typing activates fuzzy finding, filtering the current list.
* **`Ctrl+C`:** Immediately exit the application.
